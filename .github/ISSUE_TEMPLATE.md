This is a very minor issue, but the background color for the Sort By dropdown (#order_by)in the Kata library is set to transparent which makes it somewhat difficult to read. The file path for the attribute is https://www.codewars.com/assets/application-342bfbe10d15856ba3a1885b2e768360.css. The background-color for the other dropdowns is #131414.

Thanks
